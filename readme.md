# Running Ruby Scripts

### Step 1: Install Ruby
If you're on mac you probably already have ruby.

You can download ruby here: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/

### Step 2: Open the folder in a terminal
Open command prompt on Windows, or Terminal on Mac, and `cd` to the directory where you downloaded and unzipped the code.

Say you extracted the code to `~/Downloads/HerStory/` on Mac. You'd use this command:

```
cd "~/Downloads/HerStory/"
```

Or on Windows it might look like this:

```
cd "C:\Users\John Smith\Downloads\HerStory\"
```

### Step 3: Run the script

Type `ruby` followed by a space, and the name of the script to run it.

```
ruby herstory_100p.rb
```
