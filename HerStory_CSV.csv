I let him take my virginity after a night that his band had played at. It got difficult. When I was with Carl we would have sex but Hannah couldn’t. Couldn’t let him see she was a virgin. She had lots of excuses. After a while we decided that I should take Hannah's virginity. It’s not that different to a bruise pulling a tooth a graze. We used a hairbrush.

EVE,7, This was nine about nine? I went round and she was waiting for me. She was furious. And so angry. The kind of anger you can only have toward yourself. We screamed at each other. Argued. Cried.

EVE,7, It’s like I told you before. I drove. I took the car and drove. I don't have my own car but I have a spare set of keys. I just drove north. I wanted to think put some space between me and them. Everything I told you before is true. I stopped at Glasgow. I was tired exhausted. I pulled out and I hit a car. My car was OK but I was worried about the baby so I went to A and E to get the OK. Everything was fine. Slept in the car. When I woke I tried to call Hannah from a pay phone. She wasn't answering. And then I decided to drive back. I had decided that she was more important to me than Simon. ,47,764, %1%It’s like I told you before.#I drove.%4%I took the car and drove.%6%I don't have my own car;#but I have a spare set of keys.%9%I just drove; north.%12%I wanted to think; put some space#between me and them.%16%Everything I told you before is true.%19%I stopped at Glasgow.#I was tired; exhausted.%22%I pulled out and I hit a car.%26%My car was OK; but I was worried about the baby; so I went to A and E to get the OK.%30%Everything was fine.%31.5%Slept in the car.

EVE,7, Her story was that she'd waited for him to come back. She put on my wig some of my clothes. Pretended to be me. They talked. She’d enjoyed being me. He said he wanted to be with me. Then he took out a present. Another mirror. Just like the one he'd given her earlier. That unique present. She went crazy. Smashed the mirror. They argued. Screamed. He hit her. So she grabbed a piece of the mirror just swung it round. She cut his throat clean open. She’d only meant to scare him off. ,57,767, %1.8%Her story was that she'd waited#for him to come back.%6%She put on my wig; some of my clothes.%9%Pretended to be me.%12.5%They talked.%15.5%She’d enjoyed being me.%19.5%He said he wanted to be with me.%25%Then he took out a present.#Another mirror.%30%Just like the one he'd given her earlier.%34%That unique present.%39.5%She went crazy.%41%Smashed the mirror.%42.5%They argued.

EVE,7, It happened very quickly. We hardly had to talk to each other. We agreed almost silently. The baby was what mattered. We’d help each other. We cleaned up. We bagged up the broken mirror her clothes. They’re gone. We took him down to the cellar. We knew I we had an alibi and we wanted the body to be found later. We wanted to have suspicion on us so we could then disprove it  rather than have it linger. Better to keep the body in the house than risk being seen with it. The watch that was my touch. To make sure the alibi stuck. ,49,768, %0.5%It happened very quickly.%2.5%We hardly had to talk to each other.#We agreed almost silently.%7.5%The baby was what mattered.%10%We’d help each other.%13%We cleaned up.%15%We bagged up the broken mirror; her clothes.#They’re gone.%20%We took him down to the cellar.%22%We knew I; we; had an alibi and we#wanted the body to be found later.%29.75%We wanted to have suspicion on us;#so we could then disprove it…%34%…rather than have it linger.%37.7%Better to keep the body in the house than#risk being seen with it.%42%The watch; that was my touch.%45.7%To make sure the alibi stuck.%999,,,,TRUE,TRUE,75,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
